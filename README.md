# Giphy

Basic page that stores personal favorite GIF terms to search.  Will also add any user input search terms and add a button(with search term as text)
to the default buttons.  Once any of the buttons are clicked, the Giphy(https://api.giphy.com) API will be called and return the top ten gifs with the 
buttons subject.  It will also display the title of the gif as well as the rating.  

As default, the GIFs will be in a still state.  If the GIF is clicked, it will then animate(moving state).  The opposite will occur. if the GIF is 
currently in a moving state.
